Adrian Caprini CENG 317 16x2 LCD.
-------------

### December 12, 2017
* I had the trace near the IC1 on my PCB board cut. 
* finished the placard.
* Build Script: In this thirty second video I will start by having a opening title screen that has the project name and my name.  After that, I will show all the different parts that I have acquired in order to be able to build the 16x2 LCD.
Also, I will be showing all my parts assembled and connected together.  Once all of that is done I will be showing my project being powered up, as well as quickly describing how the project works.

* Demonstrated my finished PCB board.

### October 16 - November 27, 2017
During the five week strike these are the things I worked on:
* began to solder the PCB board that is due in week 7.
* all the parts for the PCB board are soldered except for the module because it was not ready when we picked up the PCB Board   
* blinked an LED with the Raspberry Pi that I bought.
* picked up the module at the prototype lab.
* acquired all my parts that are required for me to start building my project.  These parts included the Raspberry Pi and the 16x2 LCD.
* Filmed the unboxing of the parts that I acquired.

### Reading day October 9, 2017
* No class.
* Updating blog to current week (October 12, 2017).

### October 2, 2017
* Started to do some research on the parts that I would need for this project and ordered them once I knew.
* I created my Budget. 
* In the Budget I outlined what components I need for my project, as well as the cost of each part. 
* I went to go pick up my PCB board from the prototype lab.

### September 25, 2017

* I Created my [project schedule](https://github.com/adriancaprini/BluetoothProjectProposal-/blob/master/Hardware%20Production%20Project%20Schedule.mpp).

* I started working on the budget.

### September 18, 2017

* I Created my [proposal](https://github.com/adriancaprini/BluetoothProjectProposal-/blob/master/ProposalContentStudentNameRev02.pdf). 
* I outlined in the proposal what problem my project is trying to solve.

### September 11, 2017

* Wrote the tech quiz. 
* I Created my [repository](https://github.com/adriancaprini/BluetoothProjectProposal-).
