Adrian Caprini CENG 317 16x2 LCD.
-------------

### January 8, 2018
Progress Report:
16x2 LCD

The project that I decided to choose this semester was working with the 16x2 LCD.  The goal that I had for this project was being able to display information onto the 16x2 LCD.  This project took me a while to complete as there were many requirements that had to be completed before I could start to connect and work with the 16x2 LCD.  Before I could start working on this project, I had to do some documentation that included a proposal, schedule, budget and unboxing my Raspberry Pi.  Once I finished the documentation then I started to research how to connect the 16x2 LCD with my Raspberry Pi which I was able to do.

I have made good progress in meeting the goals of my project as defined in my proposal.  My main objective was to be able to get something to display on the 16x2 LCD and then be able to display the information from the light sensor.  Unforuntaely I was only able to get it to display basic information and not the information from the light sensor that we had read information from earlier on in the semester because I was not sure how to convert c code into python code.  That was one of the main problems that I encountered while working on this project.  Another problem I encountered was the guides online of how to display information on the 16x2 LCD display were using different pins then what my 16x2 LCD was using.  The guides were using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins but my LCD was using the pins of the MCP23017 chip. So this required me to test every input and output to make sure that they were connected to the right spots.  To get it to work I had to change the pins to the ones that I tested because the LCD has 2 different types of pins one is the Board pins and one was the BCM pins. Since my LCD was using the BCM pins, I had to make sure that I changed the pins I tested to the correct BCM pins on the LCD to be able to get it to display.  I spent days doing a lot of research on converting c code into python code but was unsuccessful in finding a guide that could help me with doing that.  I also spent a few days in the prototype lab asking for help but they were not able to help me with this.  In the end, I had bought an extra part which was the bread board wires which I did not end up needing, otherwise my financial budget stayed the same.

* I had the trace near the IC1 on my PCB board cut. 
* finished the placard.
* 30 second Build Script
In this thirty second video I will start by having a opening title screen that has the project name and my name.  After that, I will show all the different parts that I have acquired in order to be able to build the 16x2 LCD.
Also, I will be showing all my parts assembled and connected together.  Once all of that is done I will be showing my project being powered up, as well as quickly describing how the project works.

Opening:
* Displaying the project name and name of the sensor I will be using to build my hardware project.

Showing my acquired parts:
* "The parts I acquired in order to build my project are the Raspberry Pi and 16x2 LCD."
* Showing what the parts I acquired for my hardware project look like.

Part assembly:
* show how to connect the 16x2 LCD to the Raspberry Pi.

Powering up:
* show that the Raspberry Pi is powered up along with the test code running.

* Demonstrated my finished PCB board.

### October 16 - November 27, 2017
During the five week strike these are the things I worked on:
* began to solder the PCB board that is due in week 7.
* all the parts for the PCB board are soldered except for the module because it was not ready when we picked up the PCB Board   
* blinked an LED with the Raspberry Pi that I bought.
* picked up the module at the prototype lab.
* acquired all my parts that are required for me to start building my project.  These parts included the Raspberry Pi and the 16x2 LCD.
* Filmed the unboxing of the parts that I acquired.

### Reading day October 9, 2017
* No class.
* Updating blog to current week (October 12, 2017).

### October 2, 2017
* Started to do some research on the parts that I would need for this project and ordered them once I knew.
* I created my Budget. 
* In the Budget I outlined what components I need for my project, as well as the cost of each part. 
* I went to go pick up my PCB board from the prototype lab.

### September 25, 2017

* I Created my [project schedule](https://github.com/adriancaprini/BluetoothProjectProposal-/blob/master/Hardware%20Production%20Project%20Schedule.mpp).  
[Image of Schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/documentation/Week3RubricforProjectSchedule.jpg)
* I started working on the budget.

### September 18, 2017

* I Created my [proposal](https://github.com/adriancaprini/BluetoothProjectProposal-/blob/master/ProposalContentStudentNameRev02.pdf). 
* I outlined in the proposal what problem my project is trying to solve.

### September 11, 2017

* Wrote the tech quiz. 
* I Created my [repository](https://github.com/adriancaprini/BluetoothProjectProposal-). 
* I choose the component that I am going to use to build my project which was the 16x2 LCD. I started to work on my project proposal. 

Welcome!
