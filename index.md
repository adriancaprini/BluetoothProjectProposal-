### October 16 - November 27, 2017
During the five week strike these are the things I worked on:
* began to solder the PCB board that is due in week 7
* all the parts for the PCB board are soldered except for the module because it was not ready when we picked up the PCB Board   
* blinked an LED with the Raspberry Pi that I bought.
* picked up the module at the prototype lab.
* acquired all my parts that are required for me to start building my project.  These parts included the Raspberry Pi and the 16x2 LCD.
* Filmed the unboxing of the parts that I acquired.
